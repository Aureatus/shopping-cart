## App features
  1. Uses [Fake Store Api](https://fakestoreapi.com) to pull 12 dummy products.
  2. A catalog item component is conditionally rendered for each of the pulled products, rendering the products image, title and price. If the item is not      in the cart, render an amount input and a button to add to the cart. If item is in the cart, render "Item in cart" text instead.
  3. Cart page displays amount of items in your basket as a header, the cart items, and a section showing dynamically generated Total price, alongside a        checkout button.
  4. Each cart item displays product image, title, an amount that can be changed and a price that changes based on the amount. Users can remove a cart item      by changing the amount to be 0.
